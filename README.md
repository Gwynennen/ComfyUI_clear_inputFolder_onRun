!!!!!!! READ FIRST !!!!!!!!

Very simple ComfyUI script that clears input folder (should clear additional paths set as input folders too) every time the server starts, leaves files from list that you can specify inside code. Put main.py (can rename to whatever) or folder inside ComfyUI/custom_nodes folder.

Set filenames here:

Notes:
- consider creating copy of important files for first time use;
- server cli will show import fail but it worked when tested;
