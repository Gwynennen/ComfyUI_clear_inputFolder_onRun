!!!!!!! READ FIRST !!!!!!!!

ComfyUI node that clears input folder (should clear additional paths set as input folders too) every time the server starts with the exception of files that you can specify inside code.

Notes:
- for first time use consider creating copy of important files
- cli will show import fail on node but it worked when tested
